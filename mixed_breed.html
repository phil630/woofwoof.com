				    <p>This is Sully and Chewy.  They are brothers even though I think sometimes Sully would rather not be related.  Sully was 5 years old when Chewy came into his life.  Chewy was a complete surprise.  He was a Christmas present that did not make Sully happy, but here they are 9 years later peacefully sleeping together.</p>
				    <p>Sully is short for Sullivan from the movie Monster's Inc. and Chewy is short for Chewbaca from Star Wars. As you can see Sully doesn't look like the Sully from the movie, but he is quite hairy like him and Chewy has the same teeth as Chewbaca. </p>
				    <p>What does Sully love more than anything in the world besides us?  <b>Food!</b>  He will do anything to try to get his next bite of meal. That includes rummaging through the garbage, stealing from the kitchen counter to stealing from your plate. He'll stop at nothing. That is Sully!  Chewy was always an innocent bystander when Sully got into his capers, but he has now joined Sully in their many attempts to get food!</p>
				    <p>We got Sully when he was 11 months old 13 year ago. He couldn't stay with his previous owner so he became the newest member of our family at a time when we had no other pets and Chewy was a total surprise.</p>
				    <p>Sully's favorite place to be is either the kitchen while dinner is being made or the dinning room during breakfast, lunch, and dinner and Chewy has joined him. </p>
				    <p>Why does Sully woof sometimes? Because he doesn't like it when his brother, Chewy, bothers him. </p>
				    <p></p>
